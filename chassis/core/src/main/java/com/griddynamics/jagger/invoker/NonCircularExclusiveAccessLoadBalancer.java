/**
 * Subclass of {@link ExclusiveAccessLoadBalancer} that provides each pair of Q and E only once (does not circle an iteration).
 * As a result it works as a finite load balancer over a predefined sequence of pairs.
 * @n
 * Also as a subclass of {@link ExclusiveAccessLoadBalancer} provides guarantees
 * that each query and endpoint pair will be in exclusive access, i.e. once it is acquired by one thread
 * it won't be acquired by any other thread (virtual user) in multi threaded environment.
 * @n
 * If {@link #randomnessSeed} is not {@code null} randomly shuffles the sequence of pairs from {@link #pairSupplierFactory} using it.
